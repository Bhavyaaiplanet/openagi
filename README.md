```python
from openagi.actions.tools.serp_search import GoogleSerpAPISearch
from openagi.agent import Admin
from openagi.llms.azure import AzureChatOpenAIModel
from openagi.memory import Memory
from openagi.planner.task_decomposer import TaskPlanner
from rich.console import Console
from rich.markdown import Markdown

if __name__ == "__main__":
    config = AzureChatOpenAIModel.load_from_env_config()
    llm = AzureChatOpenAIModel(config=config)

    company_domain = input("What is the company domain?\n")
    job_domain = input("What is the job domain?\n")
    job_level = input("What level job are you looking for?\n")
    job_location = input("In what location are you for the job?\n")

    query = f"""

        actions=[GoogleSerpAPISearch],
        planner=TaskPlanner(human_intervene=False),
        memory=Memory(),
    )

    res = admin.run(
        query=query,
        description="You are an expert Internet searching agent , who gives best possible response.",
